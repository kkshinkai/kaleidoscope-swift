Kaleidoscope in Swift
=====================

> ⚠️ I highly recommend you use Terminal (or VSCode, Atom etc.) instead of Xcode
> to open the REPL in this project. Xcode's console is poor, it can't even
> handle the parentheses paired by the editor correctly. You may meet weird
> errors because of this.
>
> If you insist on using Xcode, please at least set "Product → Scheme → Edit
> Scheme → Options → Console" to "Use Terminal" instead of "Use Xcode" for all
> targets before you start.
