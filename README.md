Kaleidoscope in Swift
=====================

> ⚠️ I highly recommend that you use Terminal (or VSCode, Atom etc.) instead of
> Xcode to open the REPL in this project. Xcode's console is very poor, it can't
> even handle the parentheses paired by the editor correctly. You may meet weird
> errors because of this.
>
> `LLVMSwift` works well with Swift Packages Manager, but I cannot guarantee its
> behavior under Xcode. If you insist on using Xcode, please at least set
> "Product → Scheme → Edit Scheme → Options → Console" to "Use Terminal" instead
> of "Use Xcode" for all targets before you start.
